/*
 * Clone an MT19937 RNG from its output
 *
 * The internal state of MT19937 consists of 624 32 bit integers.
 *
 * For each batch of 624 outputs, MT permutes that internal state. By permuting
 * state regularly, MT19937 achieves a period of 2**19937, which is Big.
 *
 * Each time MT19937 is tapped, an element of its internal state is subjected
 * to a tempering function that diffuses bits through the result.
 *
 * The tempering function is invertible; you can write an "untemper" function
 * that takes an MT19937 output and transforms it back into the corresponding
 * element of the MT19937 state array.
 *
 * To invert the temper transform, apply the inverse of each of the operations
 * in the temper transform in reverse order. There are two kinds of operations
 * in the temper transform each applied twice; one is an XOR against a
 * right-shifted value, and the other is an XOR against a left-shifted value
 * AND'd with a magic number. So you'll need code to invert the "right" and the
 * "left" operation.
 *
 * Once you have "untemper" working, create a new MT19937 generator, tap it for
 * 624 outputs, untemper each of them to recreate the state of the generator,
 * and splice that state into a new instance of the MT19937 generator.
 *
 * The new "spliced" generator should predict the values of the original.
 *
 * Stop and think for a second.
 * How would you modify MT19937 to make this attack hard? What would happen if
 * you subjected each tempered output to a cryptographic hash?
 *
