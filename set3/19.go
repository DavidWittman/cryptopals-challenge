/*
 * Break fixed-nonce CTR mode using substitutions
 *
 * Take your CTR encrypt/decrypt function and fix its nonce value to 0.
 * Generate a random AES key.
 *
 * In successive encryptions (not in one big running CTR stream), encrypt each
 * line of the base64 decodes of the following, producing multiple independent
 * ciphertexts:
 *
 *     <Moved to ./data/19.tx>
 *
 * (This should produce 40 short CTR-encrypted ciphertexts).
 *
 * Because the CTR nonce wasn't randomized for each encryption, each ciphertext
 * has been encrypted against the same keystream. This is very bad.
 *
 * Understanding that, like most stream ciphers (including RC4, and obviously
 * any block cipher run in CTR mode), the actual "encryption" of a byte of data
 * boils down to a single XOR operation, it should be plain that:
 *
 *     CIPHERTEXT-BYTE XOR PLAINTEXT-BYTE = KEYSTREAM-BYTE
 *
 * And since the keystream is the same for every ciphertext:
 *
 *     CIPHERTEXT-BYTE XOR KEYSTREAM-BYTE = PLAINTEXT-BYTE (ie, "you don't
 *     say!")
 *
 * Attack this cryptosystem piecemeal: guess letters, use expected English
 * language frequence to validate guesses, catch common English trigrams, and
 * so on.
 *
 * Don't overthink it.
 * Points for automating this, but part of the reason I'm having you do this is
 * that I think this approach is suboptimal.
